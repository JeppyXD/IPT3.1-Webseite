### Setup mode

To edit the payload, enter setup mode by connecting the pin 1 (`GP0`) to pin 3 (`GND`), this will stop the pico-ducky from injecting the payload in your own machine.
The easiest way to so is by using a jumper wire between those pins as seen bellow.

### USB enable/disable mode

If you need the pico-ducky to not show up as a USB mass storage device for stealth, follow these instructions.  
Enter setup mode.  
Copy boot.py to the root of the pico-ducky.  
Copy your payload script to the pico-ducky.  
Disconnect the pico from your host PC.
Connect a jumper wire between pin 18 (`GND`) and pin 20 (`GPIO15`).
This will prevent the pico-ducky from showing up as a USB drive when plugged into the target computer.  
Remove the jumper and reconnect to your PC to reprogram.
The default mode is USB mass storage enabled.

### Changing Keyboard Layouts

Copied from [Neradoc/Circuitpython_Keyboard_Layouts](https://github.com/Neradoc/Circuitpython_Keyboard_Layouts/blob/main/PICODUCKY.md)  

#### How to use one of these layouts with the pico-ducky repository.

**Go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/Neradoc/Circuitpython_Keyboard_Layouts/releases/latest), look if your language is in the list.**

#### If your language/layout is in the bundle

Download the `py` zip, named `circuitpython-keyboard-layouts-py-XXXXXXXX.zip`

**NOTE: You can use the mpy version targetting the version of Circuitpython that is on the device, but on Raspberry Pi Pico you don't need it - they only reduce file size and memory use on load, which the pico has plenty of.**

#### If your language/layout is not in the bundle

Try the online generator, it should get you a zip file with the bundles for yout language

https://www.neradoc.me/layouts/

#### Now you have a zip file

#### Find your language/layout in the lib directory

For a language `LANG`, copy the following files from the zip's `lib` folder to the `lib` directory of the board.  
**DO NOT** modify the adafruit_hid directory. Your files go directly in `lib`.  
**DO NOT** change the names or extensions of the files. Just pick the right ones.  
Replace `LANG` with the letters for your language of choice.

- `keyboard_layout_win_LANG.py`
- `keycode_win_LANG.py`

Don't forget to get [the adafruit_hid library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_HID/releases/latest).

This is what it should look like **if your language is French for example**.

#### Modify the pico-ducky code to use your language file:

At the start of the file comment out these lines:

```py
from adafruit_hid.keyboard_layout_us import KeyboardLayoutUS as KeyboardLayout
from adafruit_hid.keycode import Keycode
```

Uncomment these lines:  
*Replace `LANG` with the letters for your language of choice. The name must match the file (without the py or mpy extension).*
```py
from keyboard_layout_win_LANG import KeyboardLayout
from keycode_win_LANG import Keycode
```

##### Example:  Set to German Keyboard (WIN_DE)

```py
from keyboard_layout_win_de import KeyboardLayout
from keycode_win_de import Keycode
```

Copy the files keyboard_layout_win_de.mpy and keycode_win_de.mpy to the /lib folder on the Pico board
```
adafruit_hid/
keyboard_layout_win_de.mpy
keycode_win_de.mpy
```
